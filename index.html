          <h3>Calibration for pressure & vacuum</h3>
          <p>
            I work with calibrating pressure and vacuum measuring instruments at
            the NMI for pressure & vaccum in Sweden. This means that we are the
            highest instance for traceablity in the SI-unit Pascal in Sweden. We
            operate in both oil, water, gas and vacuum.

          <h3>Electronics and programming</h3>
          <p>
            I studied Electro engineering at the university of Halmstad. Before
            that it was the Electricity and Energy program in serior high
            school. Always though it was interesting to tinker with electronics,
            find whats wrong and fix stuff instead of just throwing it away!
            From here i think my interest for programming woke aswell, all the
            possibilities and ability for trial and error.

          <h3>Homebrewing</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on what level of homebrewing you aim for the diffuculty
            level if very different. Myself i keep it at a quite easy level of
            mostly brewing different kinds of wine but i have also tried cider
            which I probably will try more of. Beer on the other hand I don't
            know if I feel like the effort is worth it to get an end result you
            can compare to buying it in the store.
